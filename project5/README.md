<h3>Introduction and Objectives</h3>

The program you complete in this project will compute a list of all unique words and count how many times they occur in a given input file. The same computation is performed using a sorted linked list and a binary search tree. These data structures are used to store the unique words and perform the computation.

The main objective of this project is to be able to compare the relative performance of these two data structures for solving this problem.

The goal of this project is for you to master (or at least get practice on) the following tasks:

        implementation of a reference based sorted list (this can be a modification of the sorted linked list you implemented for project 3, or a new implementation specifically for this project),
        implementation of a reference based binary search tree.
